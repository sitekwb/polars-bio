1. What versions of Polars are supported?

    Short answer: Polars <= **1.21.0** is supported.

    Long answer: We recommend handling most of the heavy lifting on the DataFusion side (e.g., using SQL and views) and relying on Polars’ streaming capabilities primarily for sinking results. This means we are not making use of the latest Polars features, and we are not in a hurry to upgrade to the newest version. However, we do plan to adopt the new Polars streaming engine in the near future. [Reference](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/20947).

2. What to do if I get  `Illegal instruction (core dumped)` when using polars-bio?
This error is likely due to the fact that the ABI of the polars-bio wheel package does not match the ABI of the Python interpreter.
To fix this, you can build the wheel package from source. See [Quickstart](quickstart.md) for more information.
```bash
#/var/log/syslog

polars-bio-intel kernel: [ 1611.175045] traps: python[8844] trap invalid opcode ip:709d3ec253cc sp:7ffcc28754e8 error:0 in polars_bio.abi3.so[709d36533000+9aab000]
```

## macOS Specific Issues

6. **What to do if I get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'polars_bio.polars_bio'` on macOS?**
   
   This is usually caused by Python trying to import from a local development directory instead of the installed package.
   
   **Solutions:**
   - Run Python from a different directory (not the polars-bio source directory):
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   python -c "import polars_bio; print('Success!')"
   ```
   - If you have an editable install, uninstall and reinstall normally:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall polars-bio -y
   pip install polars-bio
   ```

7. **What to do if I get linking/symbol errors on macOS?**
   
   This typically happens with Python from Xcode Command Line Tools or architecture mismatches.
   
   **Solutions:**
   - Use Python from Homebrew (recommended):
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.13
   /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m pip install polars-bio
   ```
   - Or download Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
   - Check your architecture matches:
   ```bash
   python -c "import platform; print(platform.machine())"
   # Should show 'arm64' for Apple Silicon or 'x86_64' for Intel
   ```

8. **How to set up a clean environment for polars-bio on macOS?**
   
   **Recommended setup:**
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew Python
   brew install python@3.13
   
   # Create virtual environment
   /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m venv polars-bio-env
   source polars-bio-env/bin/activate
   
   # Install polars-bio
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install polars-bio
   
   # Test installation
   python -c "import polars_bio; print('polars-bio installed successfully!')"
   ```

3. How to build the documentation?
   To build the documentation, you need to install the `polars-bio` package and then run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
```bash
MKDOCS_EXPORTER_PDF=false JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1 mkdocs serve  -w polars_bio
```

4. How to build the source code and install in the current virtual environment?
```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native" maturin develop --release  -m Cargo.toml
```

5. How to run the integration tests?
   To run the integration tests, you need to have the `azure-cli`, `docker`, and `pytest` installed. Then, you can run the following commands:
```bash
cd it
source bin/start.sh
JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1 pytest it_object_storage_io.py -o log_cli=true --log-cli-level=INFO
source bin/stop.sh
```
Check the `README` in `it` directory for more information.
